# Experiment1 <br>

AIM : a) Write a program that prints Hello World. <br>
      b) Write a calculator program. <br>

THEORY: <br>
C++ is a high-level programming language developed at Bell Labs, originally developed in 1979. It is extension of C programming language with object-oriented capabilities. It provides dynamic memory allocation using operators. C++ is known for its performance ad it gives the programer a high degree of control over memory and system resources. <br>
  a) Printing "Hello World !" is a very basic program to gain idea of key concept in C++ such as '#include <iostream>', 'using namespace std', 'cout<<', etc. <br>
  b) A calculator program perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. <br>

OUTPUT: <br>
1a) <br>

CONCLUSION: <br>
a) "Hello World!" program in C++ serves as an introductory example, demonstrating the basic structure of a C++ program. <br>
b)The calculator program in C++ illustrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input, control structures and basic arithmetic operations. It provides a practical example of how to build a simple yet functional application, emphasizing the importance of handling different user inputs and basic error checking. <br>
